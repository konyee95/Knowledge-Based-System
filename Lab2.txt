**********NOTES**********
**Deffaccts**
1.(deffacts startup(animal lion)(animal monkey)(animal bird))
2.(reset)

**Matching things**
1.(defrule animal
(animal ?)
=>
( printout t "animal found" crlf))
2.(run)

**Variable in patterns**
1.(defrule list-animals
(animal ?name)
=>
( printout t  ?name " found" crlf))
2.(run)

**Multiple pattern matching**
EXAMPLE 1
1.(defrule mammal
	(animal ?name)
	(warm-blooded ?name)
	(not (lays-eggs ?name))
=> 
	(assert (mammal ?name))
	(printout t ?name " is a mammal" crlf))
2.(run)

EXAMPLE 2 
1.(defrule mammal2
	(mammal ?name)
	(child-of ?name ?young)
=>
	(assert(mammal ?young))
	(printout t ?young " is a mammal" crlf))
2.(run)
